## Docker Build - Detailed Instructions

Since you have Docker installed, this is your best option!

### First Time Build:

1. Open Command Prompt
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Debridify
   ```

2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
   - Check system tray for Docker icon
   - Should show "Docker Desktop is running"

3. Run build
   ```cmd
   build-with-docker.bat
   ```

4. What happens:
   - Downloads Android build image (~3-4 GB)
   - Copies your project files
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the APK
   - Saves it to your computer

5. Find your APK:
   ```
   C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Debridify\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
   ```

### Subsequent Builds:

Much faster! (~3-5 minutes)
- Image already downloaded
- Just rebuilds the code

### Troubleshooting Docker:

**"Docker daemon not running"**
- Open Docker Desktop application
- Wait for it to start
- Try again

**"Cannot connect to Docker"**
- Restart Docker Desktop
- Or restart your computer

**"Out of disk space"**
- Docker images are large (~4-5 GB)
- Free up space and try again
